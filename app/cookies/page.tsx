<h1>What are Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage?</h1>
<p>
    Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you browse the web. Like many commercial websites, we use cookies. Cookies — and similar technologies — do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. Cookies and other technologies may also be used to measure the effectiveness of marketing and otherwise assist us in making your use of the Platform and its features more relevant and useful to you. Pixel tags (also known as web beacons or pixels) are small blocks of code on a web page or in an email notification. Pixels allow companies to collect information such as an individua`s IP address, when the individual viewed the pixel and the type of browser used. We use pixel tags to understand whether you have interacted with content on our Platform, which helps CodingNotes measure and improve our Platform and personalize your experience. Local storage allows a website to store information locally on your computer or mobile device. Local storage is mainly used to store and retrieve data in HTML pages from the same domain. We use local storage to customize what we show you based on your past interactions with our Platform. It is important to understand that cookies (and the technologies listed above) collect personal information as well as non-identifiable information.
